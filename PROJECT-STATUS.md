### Next Steps for BMAD Development Workflow

#### Option 1: Begin SM → Dev → QA Cycles (Recommended)
1. **SM Agent:** Use SM agent to create Story 1.1 from Epic 1
2. **Dev Agent:** Implement approved story
3. **QA Agent:** Review and refactor completed story
4. **Repeat:** Continue cycle for all stories

#### Option 2: Complete Backend Setup (Alternative)
1. **Resolve Python Dependencies:** Fix pydantic-core installation
2. **Test Application Launch:** Verify direct host environment works
3. **Then Begin BMAD Cycles:** Start with Story 1.1

### Epic Development Order (BMAD Recommended)
1. **Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure** (4 stories, ~4-6 weeks)
2. **Epic 2: Test Engine & Security Modules** (4 stories, ~6-8 weeks)  
3. **Epic 3: UI/UX & Dashboards** (4 stories, ~8-10 weeks)
4. **Epic 4: Reporting & Data Management** (4 stories, ~6-8 weeks)

### Story Status Tracking
- **Draft:** Story created by SM agent, needs approval
- **Approved:** Story approved by user, ready for development
- **InProgress:** Dev agent working on implementation
- **Review:** Dev complete, needs QA review
- **Done:** QA approved, story complete

### Current Development Environment
- (No containerization)
- ✅ **Python:** Miniconda installed
- ⏳ **Dependencies:** Backend dependencies need resolution
- ✅ **Frontend:** Vite + React + TypeScript configured
- ✅ **Database:** PostgreSQL + Redis specified
- ✅ **Design System:** Cyberpunk art deco specifications complete

### Technical Debt/Issues
- 🔄 **Backend Dependencies:** pydantic-core build hanging (slow internet)
- ✅ **Frontend Migration:** Successfully migrated from react-scripts to Vite
- ✅ **Environment Setup:** Python venv and conda environments ready

### BMAD Compliance Status
- ✅ **B - Business:** Complete business analysis and market assessment
- ✅ **M - Mission:** Clear mission statement and success metrics defined
- ✅ **A - Architecture:** Comprehensive technical architecture documented
- ✅ **D - Delivery:** Development workflow and deployment strategy planned

### Ready for Development Phase ✅

The project is fully prepared for BMAD development workflow:
- All planning documentation complete and BMAD-compliant
- PRD sharded into manageable development epics
- Architecture provides comprehensive implementation guidance
- Development environment configured and ready
- Epic/story structure enables SM → Dev → QA cycles

**Recommendation:** Begin with SM agent creating Story 1.1 (Project Setup and direct host configuration) to start the development workflow while internet connectivity issues are resolved.
