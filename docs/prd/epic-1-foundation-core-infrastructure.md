- Custom hooks for API integration
- Component library structure for reusability

**Design Requirements:**
- Cyberpunk color scheme: Electric Blue (#00D4FF), Neon Green (#00FF41)
- Art Deco geometric patterns and typography
- Orbitron font for headers, Courier New for body text
- Neon glow effects on interactive elements
- Dark theme with high contrast for accessibility

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Application builds and runs without errors
- [ ] Routing works correctly between all main sections
- [ ] Authentication flow redirects properly
- [ ] Design system components render with cyberpunk styling
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- [ ] Accessibility standards met (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Story 1.4: WebSocket Integration for Real-time Updates
**Objective:** Implement WebSocket communication for real-time test output and system status
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] FastAPI WebSocket endpoint implementation
- [ ] React WebSocket client with automatic reconnection
- [ ] Real-time message broadcasting system
- [ ] Event-driven architecture for test updates
- [ ] Connection state management and error handling
- [ ] Message queuing for offline scenarios
- [ ] Performance optimization for high-frequency updates

**Technical Requirements:**
- FastAPI native WebSocket support
- WebSocket connection pooling and management
- JSON message format with event types
- Automatic reconnection logic with exponential backoff
- Message acknowledgment system
- Rate limiting for WebSocket connections

**Event Types:**
- `test.started` - Test execution began
- `test.progress` - Real-time test output
- `test.completed` - Test finished with results
- `test.error` - Test execution error
- `system.alert` - Security alerts and notifications
- `user.notification` - User-specific messages

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] WebSocket connection establishes successfully
- [ ] Real-time messages display correctly in frontend
- [ ] Connection automatically reconnects after network issues
- [ ] Message ordering preserved during high-frequency updates
